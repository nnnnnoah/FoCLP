              Besides the official Ontario Road Map, the map of Eastern Ontario
              is an excellent map of the whole area from the Quebec border to
              Oshawa and is well done. This map has all the federal, provincial,
              county and township roads identified, complete with names. All
              lakes, rivers are also clearly identified.
