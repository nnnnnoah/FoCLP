          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>
            The Friends of Charleston Lake Park is a devoted volunteer
            organization dedicated to the preservation and sustainability of the
            park, its visitors, and its wildlife inhabitants. We actively
            contribute to the park's welfare through vigilant trail monitoring,
            upkeep, and resource equipment fundraising for special projects.
            Additionally, we support engaging programs and events tailored to
            campers and park users while also endorsing research initiatives
            within the park.
